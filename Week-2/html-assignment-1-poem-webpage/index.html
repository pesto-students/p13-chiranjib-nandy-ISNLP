    <!-- First Stanza -->
    <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br><br>
    Are you - Nobody - Too? <br><br>
    Then there's a pair of us! <br><br>
    Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p>
    
    <!-- Second Stanza -->
    <p>How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br><br>
    How public - like a Frog - <br><br>
    To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog! <br>
    </p>
    
    <p><em>By Emily Dickinson</em> (1891)</p>
