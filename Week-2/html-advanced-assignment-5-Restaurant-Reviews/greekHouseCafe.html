        <h1>Greek House</h1>
        <p>For a taste of the Mediterranean, those in Simi Valley can head to Greek House Cafe. Although the archetypal exterior reflects its surrounding strip mall, Greek House Café is a break from the norm. Featuring classic dishes such as Kabobs, Hummus, and Spanakopita, the menu lets diners choose their favorite Greek delights. What keeps guests returning for more are the Pita bread sandwiches and entrees. The sandwiches offer a selection of Gyro, Chicken, Lamb, or Falafel wrapped in warm pita smothered under tzatziki sauce and onions. The dinner plates come complete with Roast Potatoes or Rice, Green Veggies, Soup or Salad and Pita. Its relatively low prices allow loyal patrons to enjoy Greek House weekly without hurting the wallet. This home-style diner has won the LA’s Best Food Award consecutively since 2006 making it a Simi Valley dining destination. Whether the stomach yearns for a flavorful vegetarian or meaty meal Greek House Café satisfies the craving.</p>
